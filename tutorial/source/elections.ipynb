    "# Predict a US presidential election using Bayesian optimal polling\n",

    "In this tutorial, we explore the use of optimal experimental design techniques to create an optimal polling strategy to predict the outcome of the US presidential election. We take the 2012 election as our prior and the 2016 election as our test set: we imagine that we are conducting polling just before the 2016 election.\n",

    "and we assume all other voters vote Republican. Right before the election, the value of $\\theta$ is unknown and we wish to estimate it using polling. The winner $w$ of the election is decided by the Electoral College system. The number of electoral college votes gained by the Democrats in state $i$ is\n",
